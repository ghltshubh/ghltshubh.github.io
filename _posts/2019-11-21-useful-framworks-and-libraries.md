List of frameworks and libraries for machine learning, robotics, numerical computation, data analysis, and data visualization.


1. ROS (Robot Operating System): A collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.
2. JAX: Composable transformations of Python+NumPy programs: differentiate, vectorize, JIT to GPU/TPU, and more.
3. Numba: Numba is an open source JIT compiler that translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code.
4. Gazebo: Gazebo is a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.
5. Cupy: CuPy is an open-source matrix library accelerated with NVIDIA CUDA.
6. Ray: Ray is a fast and simple framework for building and running distributed applications.
7. Airflow: Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.
9. Kubeflow: Kubeflow is a machine learning (ML) toolkit that is dedicated to making deployments of ML workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable and scalable.
10. Ansible: Ansible is an open-source software provisioning, configuration management, and application-deployment tool.
11. Kubernetes: Kubernetes is an open-source container-orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management.
12. Luigi: Luigi is a Python module that helps you build complex pipelines of batch jobs.
