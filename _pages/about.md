I am the CTO and co-founder of [SoranoAI](https://www.sorano.co), a startup that builds AI meteorologists. Our mission is to democratize access to high-quality, localized weather forecasts using state-of-the-art machine learning and big data technologies. At SoranoAI, I lead the development of scalable machine learning pipelines that process vast amounts of meteorological data to deliver accurate and timely weather predictions.

Previously,  I worked as a research scientist at [NASA IMPACT](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/) project where I leveraged NASA earth data and machine learning to solve [remote sensing problems](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/esds-at-agu-2021). As part of the group’s outreach program I also co-organized a joint NASA/IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) challenge on applying AI to open water flood extent detection. The competition received 137 participants from 10 countries and over 400 submissions.

Prior to that I was a Scalable Deep Learning [researcher](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/2020/08/26/nccs-summer-interns-completed-successful-season-despite-covid-19) at [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov) where I worked on developing and benchmarking Deep Learning (machine learning) workflows for the [Summit Supercomputer](https://www.cnet.com/science/ibms-world-class-summit-supercomputer-gooses-speed-with-ai-abilities/) (9,216 IBM Power processors & 27,648 NVDIA V100 GPUs) (fastest in the world, 2019). At ORNL, I also worked on leveraging data optimization techniques for [large batch distributed training of deep neural networks](https://www.ornl.gov/publication/data-optimization-large-batch-distributed-training-deep-neural-networks).

I graduated with a Master's in Data Science from Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago and a Bachelor's in Design from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati.

In my previous avatar, I was a Human-Computer Interaction designer and product architect - skills I still use to freelance. I've interests that range from philosophy, science and technology to arts, music and traveling. My current interests include building things out of salvaged materials,  training and inference of computer vision and language models on Edge devices using model quantization, pruning and compression techniques. I am also interested in developing machine learning workflows that can run on the [Raspberry Pi cluster](https://www.tinkerer.in/projects/3_project/) that I built. I have always tried to balance my creativity with my scientific pursuit.
