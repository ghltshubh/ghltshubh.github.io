I am an oncoming Data Science And Engineering PhD student at [The Bredesen Center, UTK](https://bredesencenter.utk.edu).

Previously,  I worked as a research scientist at [NASA IMPACT](https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/) project where I leveraged NASA earth data and machine learning to solve [remote sensing problems](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/esds-at-agu-2021). As part of the group’s  outreach program I also co-organized a joint [NASA/IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society (GRSS) competition](https://science.msfc.nasa.gov/2021/04/22/impact-collaborates-on-the-global-flood-detection-challenge) on applying AI to the [flood extent detection](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/articles/impact-flood-competition). The competition recieved [137 participants from 10 countries and over 400 submissions](https://science.msfc.nasa.gov/2021/09/09/presentation-of-flood-extent-detection-competition-results-at-the-ieee-emerging-techniques-in-computational-intelligence-etci-2021/).

Prior to that I was a Scalable Deep Learning [researcher](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/2020/08/26/nccs-summer-interns-completed-successful-season-despite-covid-19) at [Oak Ridge National Lab](https://www.ornl.gov) where I worked on developing and benchmarking Deep Learning (machine learning) workflows for the [Summit Supercomputer](https://www.cnet.com/science/ibms-world-class-summit-supercomputer-gooses-speed-with-ai-abilities/) (fastest in the world, 2019). At ORNL, I also worked on leveraging data optimization techniques for [large batch distributed training of deep neural networks](https://www.ornl.gov/publication/data-optimization-large-batch-distributed-training-deep-neural-networks).

I graduated with a master's in Data Science from Illinois Institute of Technology Chicago and a bachelor's in Design from Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati.

In my previous avatar, I was a Human-Computer Interaction designer and product architect. I've interests that range from philosophy, science and technology to arts, music and traveling. My current hobbies include building things out of salvaged materials, tinkering with Raspberry Pi and developing workflows (mostly machine learning) that run on the Raspberry Pi cluster that I built. I have always tried to balance my creativity with my scientific pursuit.
