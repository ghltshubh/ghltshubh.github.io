  abstract  = {India as an emerging economy deals with troubles in literacy due to factors like shortage of quality academic institutions and unsuitable curriculum. Digital Technology is accredited as something which can bridge the gap between quality institutions and individuals and make learning more engaging.
  Indian Government has made use of technology in the best possible way and launched Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA)â€¡ under its Digital India initiative. It has been initiated to make at least one individual from each household digitally literate so that they develop the skills which will be needed to link with the rapidly growing digital world. This scheme aims to target the rural population including the disparaged sections of society like minorities, Below Poverty Line (BPL), women and differently-abled people.
  The use of technology in education has transmuted the whole system of education. This paper is aimed at exploring the changing state of literacy in India after introducing PMGDISHA.},
