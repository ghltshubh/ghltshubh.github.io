  abstract  = {India as an emerging economy deals with troubles in literacy due to factors like shortage of quality academic institutions and unsuitable curriculum. Digital Technology is accredited as something which can bridge the gap between quality institutions and individuals and make learning more engaging.
  Indian Government has made use of technology in the best possible way and launched Pradhan Mantri Gramin Digital Saksharta Abhiyan (PMGDISHA)â€¡ under its Digital India initiative. It has been initiated to make at least one individual from each household digitally literate so that they develop the skills which will be needed to link with the rapidly growing digital world. This scheme aims to target the rural population including the disparaged sections of society like minorities, Below Poverty Line (BPL), women and differently-abled people.
  The use of technology in education has transmuted the whole system of education. This paper is aimed at exploring the changing state of literacy in India after introducing PMGDISHA.},

  abstract={The rapid growth and wide applicability of Deep Learning (DL) frameworks poses challenges to computing centers which need to deploy and support the software, and also to domain scientists who have to keep up with the system environment and scale up scientific exploration through DL. We offer recommendations for deploying and scaling DL frameworks on the Summit supercomputer, currently atop the Top500 list, at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Leadership Computing Facility (OLCF). We discuss DL software deployment in the form of containers, and compare performance of native-built frameworks and containerized deployment. Software containers show no noticeable negative performance impact and exhibit faster Python loading times and promise easier maintenance. To explore strategies for scaling up DL model training campaigns, we assess DL compute kernel performance, discuss and recommend I/O data formats and staging, and identify communication needs for scalable message exchange for DL runs at scale. We recommend that users take a step-wise tuning approach beginning with algorithmic kernel choice, node I/O configuration, and communications tuning as best-practice. We present baseline examples of scaling efficiency 87% for a DL run of ResNet50 running on 1024 nodes (6144 V100 GPUs).},
