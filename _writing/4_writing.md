title: "Enabling Analysis in the Cloud Using NASA Earth Science Data"
description: NASA’s Earth Science Data Systems (ESDS) Program promotes open data access for open science. The Program’s open provision of data from NASA’s EOSDIS collection is a key element of its efforts to advance open science data systems for the next generation of missions, data sources, and user needs. At the end of March 2021, NASA’s EOSDIS had a data volume of more than 50 Petabytes (PB), making it one of the largest collections of Earth observing data on the planet. Scheduled high-data-volume missions are expected to increase this volume to more than 250 PB by 2025. To accommodate this expected increase in data volume and facilitate open access to these data as broadly as possible, NASA is transitioning to cloud-based archives that are more cost-effective, flexible, and scalable than on-premise data archives. This transition will also allow data users to leverage cloud compute resources to perform analysis workflows at scale next to data using technologies fostering transparency and reproducibility.
