title: "Global Flood Detection Challenge"
description: The flood event detection contest seeked to develop approaches to delineate open water flood areas as an effort to identify flood extent, an impactful disaster that occurs frequently throughout the world. The competition involved a supervised learning task -- participants developed algorithms to identify flood pixels after training their algorithm against a training set of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images.
